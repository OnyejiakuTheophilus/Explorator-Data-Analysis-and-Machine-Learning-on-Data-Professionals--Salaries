In terms of the average salary across the employment types:**\n1. In terms of the average salary earning across employment types being given in our dataset, it follows in the order: Contract > Fulltime > Freelance > parttime. In other words a contract data scientist earns more that a fulltime, partime and freelance based on average salary earing over each of the employment types.\n2. Based on the data given (the fulltime job has more value counts than the rest) the summation of all the total payment shows that fulltime job earns way higher than all the other employment types combined together. Following closely to the fulltime job is the contract type which ranks very low in salary earning. The contract type slightly earn above the parttime, which inturn earns above the freelance.\n\n**B. In terms of the  average salary across the employment types over the years:**\n1. The Contract employment type had a significant increase in salary in the year 2021 from 2020, at this point they earn much more than any employment type in any of the years.  However in the current year 2022, contract employments no longer earn as much as in the year 2020 as they currently earn the lowest.\n2. Freelancing is at its all time high in the year 2022. Its all time low in salary earning was in the year 2021. Meaning that currently, they are highly paid. They are currently\n3. Fulltime jobs has its all time low in salary earning in the year 2020, and has been on a progressive increase over the years.\n4. Partime jobs follows the same pattern as the fulltime jobs.
